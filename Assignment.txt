Assignment

The assignment is to create and then send to Ox Security IAC (Infrastructure as Code) of the
following:


1. A script to deploy a minikube cluster ( ie: minikube start )
2. A script to deploy redis server helm chart on the cluster ( ie: Redis )
3. A helm chart defining a deployment with a single container, that container should have
the ability to connect to the redis server ( ie: redis - Official Image | Docker Hub ). The
deployment should remain up, allowing the user to “exec” into the container to run redis
commands.
4. A script to deploy the above helm chart on the cluster
5. A script to “exec” to the deployment and set a new key in the redis server (OxKey) with a
value (OxValue)
6. A script to “exec” to the deployment and get the value of the key (OxKey) and print it
back out.

Please feel free to choose whichever preferred scripting language you want, Python, Bash,
Terraform, Ansible, etc. you are encouraged to add comments where you believe they are
appropriate to the interviewer to better understand your logic and intentions. When submitting
the assignment, please package all files together in a .tar or .zip file. Please include a readme
file to explain how you expect the scripts to be triggered.

You will be asked to demonstrate the assignment during the technical interview. You will be
expected to be ready for the interview with the above assignment deployed and running and
available for you to interact with. That means the cluster should be up and running with redis
and the deployment. You will be asked to “exec” to the deployment and show setting/getting
values from the redis cache during the interview. You will also be asked to perform other tasks
during the hands-on interview so that we can assess and verify your skills.
